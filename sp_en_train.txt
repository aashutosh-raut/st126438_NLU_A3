This area contains a CIE or chromaticity diagram. A CIE diagram is a representation of all the colors that a person with normal vision can see. This is represented by the colored sail-shaped area. In addition you will see a triangle that is superimposed on the diagram outlined in white. This triangle represents the outer boundaries of the color space of the device that is characterized by the inspected profile. This is called the device gamut. In addition there are black dots and yellow lines on the diagram. Each black dot represents one of the measurement points that were used to create this profile. The yellow line represents the amount that each point is corrected by the profile, and the direction of this correction.

Pre-filters process the print files before they are sent down-stream to your real print subsystem. The list shown in this field may be empty (default). The pre-filters act on the print job in the order they are listed (from top to bottom). This is done by acting as a filtering chain where the output of one filter acts as input to the next. By putting the filters into the wrong order, you can make the filtering chain fail. For example: if your file is ASCII text, and you want the output being processed by the'Multipage per Sheet 'filter, the first filter must be one that converts ASCII into PostScript. KDEPrint can utilize any external filtering program which you may find useful through this interface. KDEPrint ships preconfigured with support for a selection of common filters. These filters however need to be installed independently from KDEPrint. These pre-filters work for all print subsystems supported by KDEPrint (such as CUPS, LPRng and LPD), because they are not dependent upon them.. Amongst the pre-configured filters shipping with KDEPrint are: the Enscript text filter; a Multiple Pages per Sheet filter; a PostScript to PDF converter; a Page Selection/ Ordering filter; a Poster Printing filter; and some more.... To insert a filter into this list, simply click on the funnel icon (top-most on the right icon column group) and proceed. Please click on the other elements of this dialog to learn more about the KDEPrint pre-filters.

The orientation of the panel. Possible values are "top", "bottom", "left", "right". In expanded mode the key specifies which screen edge the panel is on. In un-expanded mode the difference between "top" and "bottom" is less important - both indicate that this is a horizontal panel - but still give a useful hint as to how some panel objects should behave. For example, on a "top" panel a menu button will pop up its menu below the panel, whereas on a "bottom" panel the menu will be popped up above the panel.

Watchglasses are round glass panes with a diameter of around 5 - 10cm, used in various experimental techniques. The border is bent upwards to allow the watchglass to hold small amounts of liquids in order to let them evaporate. The evaporation can be accelerated by heating the watchglass with a Bunsen burner. Watchglasses can also be used to cover Petri dishes or beakers, and are also suited to weighing small amounts of matter or drying them in an airing cupboard. The term watchglass is derived from the former pocket watches' protection glass which was often domed.

This key specifies the hour format used by the clock applet. Possible values are "12-hour", "24-hour", "internet", "unix" and "custom". If set to "internet", the clock will display Internet time. The Internet time system divides the day into 1000 ".beats". There are no time zones in this system, so time is the same all over the world. If set to "unix", the clock will display time in seconds since Epoch, i.e. 1970-01-01. If set to "custom", the clock will display time according to the format specified in the custom_format key.

Scheduled Printing Scheduled printing lets you control the time of the actual printout, while you can still send away your job now and have it out of your way. Especially useful is the "Never (hold indefinitely)" option. It allows you to park your job until a time when you (or a printer administrator) decides to manually release it. This is often required in enterprise environments, where you normally are not allowed to directly and immediately access the huge production printers in your Central Repro Department. However it is okay to send jobs to the queue which is under the control of the operators (who, after all, need to make sure that the 10,000 sheets of pink paper which is required by the Marketing Department for a particular job are available and loaded into the paper trays.) Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o job-hold-until=... # example: "indefinite" or "no-hold"

If true, then Metacity works in terms of applications rather than windows. The concept is a bit abstract, but in general an application-based setup is more like the Mac and less like Windows. When you focus a window in application-based mode, all the windows in the application will be raised. Also, in application-based mode, focus clicks are not passed through to windows in other applications. Application-based mode is, however, largely unimplemented at the moment.

The maximum number of "tiles" that are kept in memory. For regular RGBA8 images, each tile is about 16 kB in size. Thus, for a value of 500 tiles this usually means about 8 megabytes are used for image data. If you regularly handle large images, a greater value here might be useful. Note that this number is only a guideline for Krita, and is not guaranteed to be the actual number of tiles in memory.

When enabled, the X server is queried for the mouse's current position on each motion event, rather than relying on the position hint. This means painting with large brushes should be more accurate, but it may be slower. Perversely, on some X servers enabling this option results in faster painting.

Cookies Cookies contain information that Konqueror (or other KDE applications using the HTTP protocol) stores on your computer, initiated by a remote Internet server. This means that a web server can store information about you and your browsing activities on your machine for later use. You might consider this an invasion of privacy. However, cookies are useful in certain situations. For example, they are often used by Internet shops, so you can'put things into a shopping basket '. Some sites require you have a browser that supports cookies. Because most people want a compromise between privacy and the benefits cookies offer, KDE offers you the ability to customize the way it handles cookies. So you might want to set KDE's default policy to ask you whenever a server wants to set a cookie, allowing you to decide. For your favorite shopping web sites that you trust, you might want to set the policy to accept, then you can access the web sites without being prompted every time KDE receives a cookie.

Top Margin. This spinbox/ text edit field lets you control the top margin of your printout if the printing application does not define its margins internally. The setting works for instance for ASCII text file printing, or for printing from KMail and Konqueror. Note: This margin setting is not intended for KOffice or OpenOffice. org printing, because these applications (or rather their users) are expected to do it by themselves. It also does not work for PostScript or PDF file, which in most cases have their margins hardcoded internally. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o page-top=... # use values from "0" or higher. "72" is equal to 1 inch.

The global keybinding for creating and displaying a new Note. The format looks like "lt;Controlgt;a" or "lt;Shiftgt;lt;Altgt;F1". The parser is fairly liberal and allows lower or upper case, and also abbreviations such as "lt;Ctlgt;" and "lt;Ctrlgt;". If you set the option to the special string "disabled", then there will be no keybinding for this action.

The global keybinding for opening the "Start Here" note. The format looks like "lt;Controlgt;a" or "lt;Shiftgt;lt;Altgt;F1". The parser is fairly liberal and allows lower or upper case, and also abbreviations such as "lt;Ctlgt;" and "lt;Ctrlgt;". If you set the option to the special string "disabled", then there will be no keybinding for this action.

Using Links in Tomboy Notes in Tomboy can be linked together by highlighting text in the current note and clicking the Link button above in the toolbar. Doing so will create a new note and also underline the note's title in the current note. Changing the title of a note will update links present in other notes. This prevents broken links from occurring when a note is renamed. Also, if you type the name of another note in your current note, it will automatically be linked for you.

List of Driver Options (from PPD). The upper pane of this dialog page contains all print job options as laid down in the printer's description file (PostScript Printer Description == 'PPD '.) Click on any item in the list and watch the lower pane of this dialog page display the available values. Set the values as needed, then use one of the push buttons below to proceed: 'Save' your settings if you want to re-use them in your next job(s) too. 'Save 'will store your settings permanently until you change them again.. Click'OK' (without a prior click on'Save '), if you want to use your selected settings just once, for the next print job. 'OK' will forget your current settings when kprinter is closed again, and will start next time with the previously saved defaults. 'Cancel 'will not change anything. If you proceed to print after clicking'Cancel', the job will print with the default settings of this queue. Note. The number of available job options depends strongly on the actual driver used for your print queue. 'Raw 'queues do not have a driver or a PPD. For raw queues this tab page is not loaded by KDEPrint, and thus is not present in the kprinter dialog.

Pages per Sheet: You can choose to print more than one page onto each sheet of paper. This is sometimes useful to save paper. Note 1: the page images get scaled down accordingly to print 2 or 4 pages per sheet. The page image does not get scaled if you print 1 page per sheet (the default setting). Note 2: If you select multiple pages per sheet here, the scaling and re-arranging is done by your printing system. However, some printers are independently capable of printing multiple pages per sheet. In which case you find the option in the printer driver settings. Be careful: if you enable multiple pages per sheet in both places, your printout will not look as you intended. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o number-up=... # examples: "2" or "4"

Specifying this will block more generic window settings from taking effect. Apply Initially: The window property will be only set to the given value after the window is created. No further changes will be affected. Remember: The value of the window property will be remembered and every time time the window is created, the last remembered value will be applied. Force: The window property will be always forced to the given value. Apply Now: The window property will be set to the given value immediately and will not be affected later (this action will be deleted afterwards). Force temporarily: The window property will be forced to the given value until it is hidden (this action will be deleted after the window is hidden).

Joystick This module helps to check if your joystick is working correctly. If it delivers wrong values for the axes, you can try to solve this with the calibration. This module tries to find all available joystick devices by checking / dev/ js[0-4] and / dev/ input/ js[0-4] If you have another device file, enter it in the combobox. The Buttons list shows the state of the buttons on your joystick, the Axes list shows the current value for all axes.

Custom Margins Checkbox. Enable this checkbox if you want to modify the margins of your printouts. You can change margin settings in 4 ways: Edit the text fields. Click spinbox arrows. Move the scroll wheel of a wheel mouse. Use the mouse to drag margins in the preview frame. Note: The margin setting does not work if you load files into kprinter which have their margins hardcoded internally, such as most PDF or PostScript files. It works for all ASCII text files however. It also may not work with non-KDE applications which fail to fully utilize the KDEPrint framework, such as OpenOffice. org.

The orientation of the panel. Possible values are "top", "bottom", "left", "right". In expanded mode the key specifies which screen edge the panel is on. In un-expanded mode the difference between "top" and "bottom" is less important - both indicate that this is a horizontal panel - but still give a useful hint as to how some panel objects should behave. For example, on a "top" panel a menu button will pop up its menu below the panel, whereas on a "bottom" panel the menu will be popped up above the panel.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Tangram (Chinese: literally "seven boards of cunning") is a Chinese puzzle. While the tangram is often said to be ancient, its existence has only been verified as far back as 1800. It consists of 7 pieces, called tans, which fit together to form a square; taking the square as the unit: \t* 5 right isosceles triangles \t\to 2 small (legs of 1) \t\to 1 medium size (legs of square root of 2) \t\to 2 large size (legs of 2) \t* 1 square (side of 1) \t* 1 parallelogram (sides of 1 and square root of 2)

Sets the swap file location. GIMP uses a tile based memory allocation scheme. The swap file is used to quickly and easily swap tiles out to disk and back in. Be aware that the swap file can easily get very large if GIMP is used with large images. Also, things can get horribly slow if the swap file is created on a folder that is mounted over NFS. For these reasons, it may be desirable to put your swap file in "/tmp".

This graph gives you an overview of the usage of physical memory in your system. Most operating systems (including Linux) will use as much of the available physical memory as possible as disk cache, to speed up the system performance. This means that if you have a small amount of Free Physical Memory and a large amount of Disk Cache Memory, your system is well configured.

More precisely, this setting overrides any specified host and port part in a LDAP URL and will also be used if host and port have been omitted from the URL. Other LDAP servers will be used only if the connection to the "proxy" failed. The syntax is "HOST" or "HOST: PORT". If PORT is omitted, port 389 (standard LDAP port) is used.

First Chamber. Dig down to collect the top left piece of gold. Fall onto the enemies to get the gold on the right. Dodge them to pick up the rest. Trap the enemies high on the right while you dig out through the bottom of the chamber. As you emerge, you must drop straight onto the ladder next to the concrete. Climb down that ladder, under the concrete to the right and then up to the top of the next chamber. Second Chamber. Proceed left to right with the shafts, using your digging skills to get the gold. On the rightmost shaft, dig left while falling, then fall left while digging both left and right. In the three-brick platform now remaining, dig the left brick, then the right and the center while falling right. Pick up the gold on the right and fall onto the last gold piece while digging left. Dig left again, fall onto the ladder next to the concrete, as before, and go on up to the next chamber. Third Chamber. Dig right, fall on the left gold piece and immediately dig right to trap the enemy, then dig and exit left. Repeat, one brick over, for the gold piece on the right. Now go back to the top and fall into the lower section, on top of the enemy. Take the short pole left and step across the falling enemy to grab the long pole going left. Fall on the gold, dig to trap the enemy, dig again and exit left. Repeat for the other hanging gold piece. This time dig down and out, onto the ladder next to the concrete, and so to the last chamber. Fourth Chamber. Trap the enemy, run to the top, dig through to the concrete on the left, wait for the enemy and fall on him to get at more gold on the left. When all the gold in this chamber is gone, run to the bottom and fall through to the floor. Now pick up the rest of the gold and get out quick.

Using Links in Tomboy Notes in Tomboy can be linked together by highlighting text in the current note and clicking the Link button above in the toolbar. Doing so will create a new note and also underline the note's title in the current note. Changing the title of a note will update links present in other notes. This prevents broken links from occurring when a note is renamed. Also, if you type the name of another note in your current note, it will automatically be linked for you.

The transport encoding of this part: normally, you do not need to change this, since %1 will use a decent default encoding, depending on the MIME type; yet, sometimes, you can significantly reduce the size of the resulting message, e. g. if a PostScript file does not contain binary data, but consists of pure text -- in this case, choosing "quoted-printable" over the default "base64" will save up to 25% in resulting message size.

Message Disposition Notification Policy MDNs are a generalization of what is commonly called read receipt. The message author requests a disposition notification to be sent and the receiver's mail program generates a reply from which the author can learn what happened to his message. Common disposition types include displayed (i. e. read), deleted and dispatched (e. g. forwarded). The following options are available to control KMail's sending of MDNs: Ignore: Ignores any request for disposition notifications. No MDN will ever be sent automatically (recommended). Ask: Answers requests only after asking the user for permission. This way, you can send MDNs for selected messages while denying or ignoring them for others. Deny: Always sends a denied notification. This is only slightly better than always sending MDNs. The author will still know that the messages has been acted upon, he just cannot tell whether it was deleted or read etc. Always send: Always sends the requested disposition notification. That means that the author of the message gets to know when the message was acted upon and, in addition, what happened to it (displayed, deleted, etc.). This option is strongly discouraged, but since it makes much sense e. g. for customer relationship management, it has been made available.

Some mail advertisements are in HTML and contain references to, for example, images that the advertisers employ to find out that you have read their message ("web bugs"). There is no valid reason to load images off the Internet like this, since the sender can always attach the required images directly to the message. To guard from such a misuse of the HTML displaying feature of KMail, this option is disabled by default. However, if you wish to, for example, view images in HTML messages that were not attached to it, you can enable this option, but you should be aware of the possible problem.

Poster Size Select the poster size you want from the drop-down list. Available sizes are all standard paper sizes up to'A0 '. [A0 is the same size as 16 sheets of A4, or '84cm x 118.2cm'.] Notice, how the little preview window below changes with your change of poster size. It indicates to you how many tiles need to be printed to make the poster, given the selected paper size. Hint: The little preview window below is not just a passive icon. You can click on its individual tiles to select them for printing. To select multiple tiles to be printed at once, you need to'shift-click 'on the tiles ('shift-click' means: hold down the [SHIFT]-key on your keyboard and click with the mouse while [SHIFT]-key is held.) The order in which you click dictates the order in which the tiles are printed. The order of your selection (and of the printed tiles) is indicated by the contents of the text field labelled as'Tile pages (to be printed): 'Note: By default, no tiles are selected. Before you can print (a part of) your poster, you must select at least one tile.

This transformation may introduce small image distortions along one or more edges, because the image dimensions are not multiples of 8. The distortion is reversible, however. If the resulting image is unacceptable, simply apply the reverse transformation to return to the original image. You can also choose to discard (or trim) any untransformable edge pixels. For practical use, this mode gives the best looking results, but the transformation is not strictly lossless anymore.

The global keybinding for opening the Recent Changes dialog. The format looks like "lt;Controlgt;a" or "lt;Shiftgt;lt;Altgt;F1". The parser is fairly liberal and allows lower or upper case, and also abbreviations such as "lt;Ctlgt;" and "lt;Ctrlgt;". If you set the option to the special string "disabled", then there will be no keybinding for this action.

Gamma: Slider to control the gamma value for color correction. The gamma value can range from 1 to 3000. A gamma value greater than 1000 lightens the print. A gamma value less than 1000 darkens the print. The default gamma is 1000. Note: the gamma value adjustment is not visible in the thumbnail preview. Additional hint for power users: This KDEPrint GUI element corresponds to the CUPS command line job option parameter: -o gamma=... # use range from "1" to "3000"

No subtree check This option disables subtree checking, which has mild security implications, but can improve reliability is some circumstances. If a subdirectory of a filesystem is exported, but the whole filesystem is not, then whenever a NFS request arrives, the server must check not only that the accessed file is in the appropriate filesystem (which is easy) but also that it is in the exported tree (which is harder). This check is called the subtree_check. In order to perform this check, the server must include some information about the location of the file in the "filehandle" that is given to the client. This can cause problems with accessing files that are renamed while a client has them open (though in many simple cases it will still work). subtree checking is also used to make sure that files inside directories to which only root has access can only be accessed if the filesystem is exported with no_root_squash (see below), even the file itself allows more general access. As a general guide, a home directory filesystem, which is normally exported at the root and may see lots of file renames, should be exported with subtree checking disabled. A filesystem which is mostly read-only, and at least does not see many file renames (e. g. / usr or / var) and for which subdirectories may be exported, should probably be exported with subtree checks enabled.

In Administration, you can create different profiles. In each profile, you can have a different set of users and select which activities are available to them. To run GCompris for a specific profile, you use 'gcompris -p profile' where 'profile' is the name of a profile as you created it in Administration.

This displays 2D projections of the sequence of 3D objects which are the projections of the 4D analog to the cube: as a square is composed of four lines, each touching two others; and a cube is composed of six squares, each touching four others; a hypercube is composed of eight cubes, each touching six others. To make it easier to visualize the rotation, it uses a different color for the edges of each face. Do n't think about it too long, or your brain will melt. See also "polytopes" for a more general version of this using OpenGL. http: / /en. wikipedia. org/ wiki/ Hypercube http: / /en. wikipedia. org/ wiki/ Regular_polytope Written by Joe Keane, Fritz Mueller, and Jamie Zawinski; 1992.

The format looks like "<Control>a" or "<Shift><Alt>F1". The parser is fairly liberal and allows lower or upper case, and also abbreviations such as "<Ctl>" and "<Ctrl>". If you set the option to the special string "disabled", then there will be no keybinding for this action. This keybinding may be reversed by holding down the "shift" key; therefore, "shift" cannot be one of the keys it uses.

In the text entry, enter one command per line, to control your boat. Commands supported are displayed between the two entry areas. The 'left' and 'right' commands must be followed by an angle in degrees. The angle value is also called a 'parameter' to the left or right command. By default 45 degrees is used. The 'forward' command accepts a distance parameter. By default 1 is used. For example: - left 90: Make a perpendicular left turn - forward 10: Go forward for 10 units (as displayed on the ruler). The goal is to reach the right of the screen (the red line). When done, you can try to improve your program and start a new race with the same weather conditions by using the retry button. You can click and drag your mouse anywhere on the map to get a measurement in distance and angle. Going to the next level will give you more complex weather conditions.

If you want to set the folder names of the IMAP storage to your local language, you can choose between these available languages. Please note, that the only reason to do so is for compatibility with Microsoft Outlook. It is considered a bad idea to set this, since it makes changing languages impossible.

You can see some cards, but you can't see what's on the other side of them. Each card is hiding an operation, or the answer to it. In this game, these cards are hiding the two parts of an operation. You need to find the two parts of the operation, and bring them together again. Click on a card to see what number it's hiding, then try to find the other card that goes with it, to make a whole operation. You can only turn over two cards in one go, so you need to remember where the numbers are hiding, then you can match them when you find their other half. You're doing the job of the equals sign, and the numbers need you to put them together and make a proper equality. When you do that, both those cards disappear! When you've made them all disappear, found all the operations, you've won the game! :)

Local Network Browsing Here you setup your "Network Neighborhood". You can use either the LISa daemon and the lan: / ioslave, or the ResLISa daemon and the rlan: / ioslave. About the LAN ioslave configuration: If you select it, the ioslave, if available, will check whether the host supports this service when you open this host. Please note that paranoid people might consider even this to be an attack. Always means that you will always see the links for the services, regardless of whether they are actually offered by the host. Never means that you will never have the links to the services. In both cases you will not contact the host, so nobody will ever regard you as an attacker. More information about LISa can be found at the LISa Homepage or contact Alexander Neundorf & lt; neundorf@kde. org gt;.

For example, if your device is / dev/ st0, the non-rewinding version is / dev/ nst0. If your device name does not look like that, type "ls -l %1" in a terminal window to see the real name of your tape drive. Substitute that name for / dev/ nst0 below. Open a terminal window and type the following: tar tfv / dev/ nst0; tar tfv / dev/ nst0 tar xfv / dev/ nst0 The third call to "tar" will retrieve your data into your current directory. Please let us know if this happens to you. - KDat Maintenance Team
